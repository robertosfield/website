VulkanSceneGraph (VSG), is a modern, cross platform, high performance scene graph library built upon [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) graphics/compute API. The software is written in [C++17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B17), and follows the [CppCoreGuidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) and [FOSS Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/criteria). The source code is published under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md).

The project aims to bring the performance of Vulkan to the wider developer community by providing a modern, high quality software library that is easy to use and focused on making the development of high performance graphics and compute applications a productive and fun experience. Sharing the same lead author as the OpenSceneGraph, all the lessons about software quality, performance and the needs of application developers are applied to VulkanSceneGraph to provide a distillation of what a next gen scene graph needs to be.
